https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/janatahack-independence-day-2020-ml-hackathon/#About

Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.
Given the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. 

**Note that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics:**

1. Computer Science
2. Physics
3. Mathematics
4. Statistics
5. Quantitative Biology
6. Quantitative Finance

**Evaluation Metric**
Submissions are evaluated on micro F1 Score between the predicted and observed topics for each article in the test set

**Public and Private Split**
Test reviews are further divided into Public (40%) and Private (60%)

**Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data.**
The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.
 

**Guidelines for Final Submission**
Please ensure that your final submission includes the following:

**Solution file containing the predicted 1/0 for each of the 6 topics for every research article in the test set**
Code file for reproducing the submission, note that it is mandatory to submit your code for a valid final submissi
